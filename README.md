Description
BlackSYNReaper is a C# SYN flood DDoS testing tool by batucs15. It sends TCP SYN packets to a target IP and port using multiple threads to stress-test network systems. Designed for educational and security testing purposes in controlled environments, this tool helps evaluate system resilience against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
Features

Configurable target IP, port, and thread count for tailored testing.
Asynchronous SYN flood implementation for high-performance stress testing.
Sleek ASCII art banner for a killer interface ðŸ˜Ž.
Open-source under the MIT License.

Requirements

.NET Core or .NET Framework (6.0+ recommended).
A target system with a running service (e.g., a web server on port 80).
Explicit permission to test the target system.

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/batucs15/BlackSYNReaper.git
cd BlackSYNReaper


Verify .NET is installed:dotnet --version


Run the tool:
dotnet run



Usage

Launch the program:dotnet run


Follow the prompts:
Target IP: Enter the IP address of the system to test (e.g., a local server).
Target Port: Specify the service port (e.g., 80 for HTTP).
Number of Threads: Choose the number of concurrent connections (e.g., 30 for moderate stress).


The tool initiates a SYN flood, sending TCP SYN packets to the target.
Monitor the target systemâ€™s performance using tools like:sudo apt install htop
htop
sudo apt install tcpdump
sudo tcpdump -i <interface> port 80


Stop the test with Ctrl+C when finished.
